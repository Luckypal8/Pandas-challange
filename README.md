PyCitySchools.ipynb is the main Jupyter notebook that shows analysis of the district and charter school budget and priorities. It shows district summary of total schools, students, budget and averages. It also has summary of schools, highest performing and lower performing schools, scores by school size and school type. 
There is an analysis of the trends based on this data


Trend 1 =  School spending per student does not show direct relation with overall performance. 
For example schools with $645 and upwards spending per student had a much lower percentage of overall passing at 53.53% as compared to below $584 at 90.64%.
 

Trend 2 = Charter schools perform better than district schools

Over Charter schools performed better in all the metrics. Charter schools had an overall passing percentage of >89% while district schools were <55%.
